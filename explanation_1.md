### Implementation

- In order to complete O(log(n)), I selected Binary Search algorithm in here. 
- Compare the square of middle value to given number, if less than number, result must locate in left half range;if more than number, that must locate in right half range
Worst case time: O(log(n));
Space complexity: O(1)
