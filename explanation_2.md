# Implementation

- In order to complete O(log(n)), I also selected Binary Search algorithm in here. 
- Compare the given number to middle value, if less than middle value, result must locate in left half range;if more than number, that must locate in right half range
Worst case time: O(log(n));
Space complexity: O(1)
