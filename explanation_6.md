### Implementation

- I initialized maxnum and minnum with the built-in function of float-[inf,-inf]
- if number is more than current maxnum, it will replace the maxnum variable
- if number is less than current minnum, it will replace the maxnum variable

Worst case time:  
one for loop:O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
